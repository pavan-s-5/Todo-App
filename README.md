# Todo-App - React Js

    Features of the App :

Todo App is a responsive web application built using React JS, designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.

The Todo App offers a range of filter options, allowing users to view tasks based on their status: all tasks, pending tasks, or completed tasks.

To streamline task management, the app includes a convenient "Clear All" button, enabling users to remove all completed tasks with a single click.

The app uses the browser's local storage, ensuring that the task list is saved even if the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.

When there are no tasks to display, the app gracefully informs the user with a clear message: "No tasks to show."

The Todo App incorporates custom CSS styling and employs multiple components, resulting in a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
